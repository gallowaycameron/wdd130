        <p>Hello I am Cameron Galloway. I am from Utah, USA. I am a Furniture Finisher (stain and lacquer furniture) for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I enjoy riding my bikes, both my peddal and motorcycle, when the weather is good. I also enjoys hiking in the mountians around Utah, diving into a good book, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and playing video games with my friends and family.</p>
